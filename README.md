This project explores key feature detection and matching techniques using SIFT, ORB, and Shi-Tomasi algorithms in OpenCV.
SIFT was used to detect and match scale- and rotation-invariant keypoints between image pairs.
ORB, being a faster alternative, helped achieve similar matching with fewer computational resources.
Shi-Tomasi corner detection was applied to highlight distinct structural points, especially in high-contrast images like X-rays.
We also combined Canny edge detection with Shi-Tomasi to visualize both edges and corners, enabling detailed structural analysis.
